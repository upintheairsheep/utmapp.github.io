UTM does not collect any personal information directly.

## Third Party
When UTM is launched for the first time after an update, a single request to `api.github.com` is made in order to fetch the release notes. If update checking is enabled, a request to `api.github.com` will be made on each launch.

GitHub may collect IP addresses of clients that connect to their API services and [their privacy policy][1] states that they "may use your information to provide, administer, analyze, manage, and operate our Service."
